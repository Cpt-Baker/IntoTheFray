This is a fast-paced aerial combat game developed over the course of a semester. The project was built using Unity and features a fully implemented Finite State Machine (FSM) for AI, dynamic dogfighting mechanics, and a functional HUD. It's not perfect by any means, but it's something I might come back to in the future
