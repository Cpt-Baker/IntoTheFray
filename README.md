This is a fast-paced aerial combat game developed over the course of a semester. The project was built using Unity and features a fully implemented Finite State Machine (FSM) for AI, dynamic dogfighting mechanics, and a functional HUD. It's not perfect by any means, but it's something I might come back to in the future


**Controls & How to Win**

~ How to Win:
The objective is to destroy all supply depots, with the option of eliminating enemy jets (Not recommended)
Dogfight enemy jets by maneuvering and aiming carefully with the HUD boresight.
Use missiles for high-damage long-range attacks and machine guns for close combat.
Avoid enemy fire and monitor your health and missile cooldown using the HUD.
Once all supply depots are destroyed, you can progress to the next level by flying through the green highlight which appears in the sky.
The game is won when you successfully complete all 3 levels.


I didn't have much time to tweak the AI, so it's really hard to destroy them without dying, so my best advice is to just fly away and focus on destroying all the supply depots.

Warning: This is a prototype so there are quite a few bugs
At the moment there isn't a barrier blocking you from leaving the map so trying staying in bounds
